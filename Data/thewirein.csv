"A new report by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese, shows how “third states” have provided direct support, material aid, diplomatic protection and, in some cases, active participation in the Gaza genocide by Israel.

In her report, Albanese calls the Gaza genocide a “collective crime.”

“The ongoing genocide in Gaza is a collective crime, sustained by the complicity of influential Third States that have enabled longstanding systemic violations of international law by Israel. Framed by colonial narratives that dehumanize the Palestinians, this livestreamed atrocity has been facilitated through Third States’ direct support, material aid, diplomatic protection and, in some cases, active participation,” the report notes.

The report identifies four sectors of support: diplomatic, military, economic and humanitarian. Each is indispensable to the ongoing Israeli violations of international law, it says.

India finds two mentions in the ‘military ties’ section.

First, it is among states which have supplied parts, components and weapons to Israel through an opaque system that obscures transfers, including ‘dual use’ and indirect transfers. Between October 2023 and October 2025, the report says, 26 states sent at least 10 consignments of “arms and ammunition”to Israel. The most frequent was China, including Taiwan, but also in the list are India, Italy, Austria, Spain, Czechia, Romania and France.

"UN chief Antonio Guterres on Wednesday (October 22) called for a fightback against climate disinformation ahead of next month’s COP30 summit after US President Donald Trump branded climate change the “greatest con job ever”.

Guterres issued a robust defence of “clear-eyed” climate science and data, without which, he said, the world would never have understood the emergence of the “dangerous and existential threat of climate change”.

“We must fight mis- and disinformation, online harassment, and greenwashing,” Guterres said at the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) weather and climate agency in Geneva.

“Scientists and researchers should never fear telling the truth.”

Guterres’s remarks will be seen in some quarters as a riposte to Trump’s speech at the United Nations in New York last month, in which the Republican president championed fossil fuels and derided green technologies.

“Climate change – it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” said Trump.

The “carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions”, he said.

"All the living hostages held by Hamas returned to Israel this week. The 20 men have been reunited with their ecstatic families. It’s extraordinary that they are still alive, more than two years after Hamas and its allies seized them along with around 230 others after the attacks of October 7. They survived two years of captivity, of war, of privation. They survived when other hostages died during Israeli raids. They survived when the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) killed at least 67,000 Palestinians – more than 80% of them civilians, according to leaked Israeli sources – during two years of aerial and ground assaults.

The survival of these 20 Israelis is a testament to their resilience, yes, but more so to their value. The hostages were the only asset that Hamas could trade for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a ceasefire to end the war, and a deal to guarantee a Palestinian state.

Israel released 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for these 20 men and more than 20 dead hostages. It has stopped bombing Gaza (though it is still killing people on the ground for alleged ceasefire violations). The IDF has withdrawn from some of the land it has occupied in Gaza. Israel is still restricting aid to the region to punish Gazans because Hamas has not returned all the bodies of the dead hostages (which may be held by other factions or lie inaccessible under the rubble).

Hamas is left with almost nothing. True, it too has survived, even though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised not to end the war without extinguishing Hamas. But without the hostages as collateral, the organization has no leverage to force the IDF to relinquish further territory or to guarantee that the Israeli government won’t resume bombing Gaza. As for Palestinian statehood, it remains as elusive after this hostage exchange as it has been for years.

"Criticism has begun to grow over the arrival of foreign universities in India. Is this criticism justified?

After news broke that eight British universities were going to open their campuses in India, a debate followed. The University of Southampton has already set up its campus in Gurugram. Permissions have been granted for the University of Liverpool and Lancaster University in Bengaluru, the University of York, the University of Aberdeen, and the University of Bristol in Mumbai, and for Queen’s University Belfast, Coventry University, and the University of Surrey in Gujarat’s Gift City, Gandhinagar.

Following the recent meeting between the prime ministers of India and Britain, both leaders expressed their delight over this development. The British prime minister proudly announced that the UK had now become the largest provider of higher education in India.

His happiness has a clear, practical reason. He told his people that the expansion of British higher education institutions in India would bring Britain a profit of about £50 million. For a struggling British economy, this is not a small figure. There are other advantages too. In recent years, Britain has grown uneasy about the rising number of foreigners entering its borders, and efforts have been made to limit their entry. Among these are many students who go to Britain for study and then stay back in search of work. The demand for work visas has steadily increased – something the British government wants to contain. But if student visas are curbed, how will the lost income be compensated?

"My generation – the Baby Boomers who’ve seen extensive scarcity and deprivation – will know what I’m talking about. In our youth, mohalla cricket was ‘the thing’ but whether there would be a game or not, depended on the rich boy who owned bat, ball and plastic stumps on a stand. He had to be humoured in every which way, mollycoddled to the extent that until he had scored runs to his satisfaction, the umpire would rule ‘no ball’ post-facto even if he was clean bowled. He was crude and rude, and yet he bossed the show. We hated him but had to lump it because we were desperate to play cricket and that would be impossible without the boy. Even at that tender age, we employed the art of sinful compromise and submissiveness before money power.

I was reminded of cricketing injustice and my abject conduct in the distant past by the present day shenanigans of the rich boy of international cricket – the Indian cricket establishment. It’s grotesque. The entire international cricketing fraternity is presently dancing to the tune of Jay Shah whose claim to fame is that he is associated with the supreme boss of India.

Not so long ago, my battered heart retched a little on seeing an ICC-sponsored video of the World Test Championship final between South Africa and Australia in June this year which South Afrcia won on the back of phenomenal performances by Aiden Markram and Kagiso Rabada. The video featured eleven separate shots of Shah but only two of Markram, a testament to the dominance of politics in cricket, the almighty power of the Indian cricket syndicate and the craven submissiveness of other international cricket bodies.

The reality is that the Indian cricket establishment is today the bullyboy on the international cricket stage because of its monstrous financial clout. It has coerced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to do its bidding, however unreasonable the demands.

"Voters in Aland, Karnataka, may have been targeted for Rs 80 a name, according to the Special Investigative Team (SIT) of the Karnataka government set up to examine alleged instances of voter list fraud. The revelations add credibility to the Congress party and Rahul Gandhi’s longstanding claims about systemic voter fraud.

The SIT’s Rs 80 per deleted voter figure, reported by various media outlets over October 22 and 23, perhaps indicate an organised operation, not a one-off mistake or administrative error. The worrying signal is that voter deletion has turned into a paid gig economy crime, done casually and without thought for citizens’ right to vote.

While the SIT is still examining the money trail – where the Rs 4.8 lakh to fund deletion of 6,018 voters came from – it claims to have established who got the money, and alleges Kalaburagi locals Mohammad Ashfaq and Md Akram were part of the chain.

SIT findings so far

The Indian Express reports that these two private operators, according to the SIT, ran a data centre with employees working as data operators, and placed requests on behalf of voters to delete their names in the Aland assembly constituency electoral rolls.

During its ground-level investigation of the 6,018 deleted voters, the SIT could identify 24 voters as having moved away. In other words, over 99% of the voter deletions were fraudulent – of people who might have voted, had their names remained on the voter lists drawn up by the Election Commission.

"In a year in which personal income taxes have surpassed corporate taxes in India, the Reserve Bank of India has reported that profitability of Indian companies has risen nearly threefold between 2020-21 and the financial year 2025.

According to analysis that the RBI has included in its October bulletin, during COVID, despite a contraction in sales, decline in raw material cost due to softening of commodity prices, subdued wage growth, along with the favourable base effect, net profit of corporates at the aggregate level rose sharply by 115.6%.

This led to the net profit margin surpassing pre-COVID level.

In the last quarter, India’s GDP growth itself slowed down to 6.5% in 2024-25 – the slowest since the pandemic.

In 2025, the corporate profit-to-GDP ratio for the Nifty-500 Universe remained at 4.7%, marking a 17-year high, according to a note by Motilal Oswal. Notably, for listed India Inc., the ratio stood at 5.1%, at a 14-year high.

"This latest heist at the Louvre highlights the vulnerability of objects in public collections. The irony being they’re often gifted to such institutions for safekeeping.

---

The world’s largest art museum, the Louvre has approximately half a million objects in its collection, with about 30,000 on display, and sees on average 8 million visitors per year. That’s big on any scale, with a lot of people and objects to keep watch over. And Sundays are particularly busy.

In a cleverly conceived operation, four men wearing fluorescent vests pulled up at the Louvre in a flat-decked truck at 9.30 Sunday morning. Quickly setting to work, they raised an extendable ladder to the second storey. Climbing it, they cut through a window, entered the Galerie d’Apollon and, brandishing power tools, helped themselves to nine exquisite objects.

The objects taken were France’s royal jewels, formerly belonging to the Empress Eugénie, Napoleon III’s wife and arts patron.

This is where it gets tricky for the thieves: what can you do with these priceless objects? They can’t wear them – too big and glitzy to go unnoticed – and they can’t sell them legitimately, as images are all over the internet.

The best-case scenario, from the thieves’ perspective, is to break them down, melt the precious metals and sell the gems separately.

Empress Eugenie’s crown, which the perpetrators took and subsequently dropped as they fled the scene on motor scooters, contains eight gold eagles, 1,354 brilliant-cut diamonds, 1,136 rose-cut diamonds and 56 emeralds. In short, this amounts to a sizeable stash of individual gems to try and sell.

“After discussions with all senior leaders, we have decided that Tejashwi Yadav will be the CM face of the mahagathbandhan in upcoming Bihar polls,” said senior Congress leader and former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot.

“He is a young leader and has a long future ahead. In my experience those who have a long future ahead, the public stands with them. Along with this, our OBC leader Mukesh Sahani who has reached here after a long struggle on his own…we have decided to make him the deputy chief ministerial face. Alliance members from other communities will also be made deputies,” Gehlot added.

*The choice of Sahani*

The move to make Sahani as the alliance’s deputy chief ministerial face is aimed at eroding Nitish’s traditional base over the EBCs, over which the incumbent chief minister has kept consistent policy focus over his 20-year-long term including through the creation of the category itself and their symbolic representation.

"On October 22, several Ladakhi leaders comprising the Leh Apex Body (LAB) and the Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) met with senior officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs to discuss the events of September 24, when alleged police action towards protestors in Leh led to four deaths and left around 90 injured.

The LAB and the KDA, the two organisations rallying for full statehood and protection under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, were joined by the chief executive councillors (CECs) of the Leh and Kargil Autonomous Hill Development Councils. The representatives were led by Lok Sabha MP from Ladakh Mohammed Haneefa Jan, and a legal expert.

The Union government was represented by senior officials from the Union home ministry, Intelligence Bureau (IB), finance ministry and Pawan Kotwal, chief secretary of the Union territory of Ladakh.

The meeting, as described by the attendees, was an informal one, meant to break the ice after the tension following the events of late September. This dialogue between Leh and Delhi is the first meeting after protests in Leh over demands for statehood and constitutional safeguards turned violent.

"Worker unions have demanded an increase in the honorarium of cook-cum-helpers associated with the school meal programme. The demand comes at a time when the Centre has initiated the process of restructuring the Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman (PM-Poshan) scheme, which was earlier known as the Midday Meal Scheme.

The department of school education and literacy under the education ministry has informed the state governments that the PM-POSHAN scheme will be restructured soon. The ministry has sought suggestions and inputs from states and Union Territories for improvements and modifications in the scheme.

Nearly 11 crore children in 10.35 lakh government and aided primary and upper primary schools are given one hot-cooked meal on every school day. In rural areas, nearly 25 lakh cook-cum-helpers are engaged in the preparation of food and in cleaning and maintaining the school kitchens. However, these cook-cum-helpers are paid a meager Rs 1,000 a month as honorarium for 10 months a year, despite working for about five hours a day.

The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) and the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (Citu) have demanded that workers under government schemes, including PM‑POSHAN, be granted employee status and paid wages equivalent to the minimum wage.

"The Allahabad high court has held that even if a WhatsApp message does not explicitly mention religion, “unsaid words” and “subtle message” can amount to promoting enmity between religious communities.

A division bench of J.J. Munir and Pramod Kumar Srivastava had passed this ruling on September 26, while dismissing a petition filed by Afaq Ahmad, a resident of Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.

In the said WhatsApp message, Afaq had allegedly said that his brother had been “framed in a false case by putting political pressure on the police”, and lamented that “a call has been made for a total boycott of my family’s livelihood”. He had also expressed the fear that he may be lynched, reported Indian Express.

On July 30, an FIR against Afaq was registered by a police sub inspector on the basis of this WhatsApp message he sent to two people.

Earlier on July 19, Arif Ahmad, the brother of Afaq, was arrested after RSS worker Sandeep Kaushik filed an FIR accusing Arif of obscenity in public, provoking breach of peace, and criminal intimidation.

Later, additional charges pertaining to rape, administering poison, cheating, forgery, and unlawful religious conversion through misrepresentation or allurement under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021 was added to the FIR. Arif remains in jail.

"Dr Armaity S. Desai was former principal, College of Social Work, Nirmala Niketan, Mumbai; former director, Tata Institute of Social Sciences and former chairperson, University Grants Commission. She passed away on September 27, 2025, at the age of 91.

---

I stared at a blank page, numbed by the thought that Dr Armaity Desai, the former director of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), was gone. As words tumbled out, a smile began and expanded across my face.

I was fortunate to have known Armaity Desai for over 50 years at different stages of life. She was primarily a social worker and lived that in her various roles as a fieldwork supervisor, social work educator, research guide, principal and director of the institutions she was part of. At the College of Social Work, Nirmala Niketan, Mumbai, she often wore a gajra and matching bangles with a smile for everyone. The bangles and gajra disappeared over the years, but the smile and greeting continued throughout her life.

She was extremely encouraging as a field supervisor – my recordings were full of positive tick marks and very significant points for reflection. I used to wait eagerly to get my recordings back and attend the fieldwork conferences. Deciphering her handwriting was a major challenge, and as her student, I had to master it in order to read her comments.

"A flagship US climate-disaster database killed by President Donald Trump’s administration has been brought back to life by its former lead scientist – revealing that extreme weather inflicted a record $101 billion in damages in just the first half of 2025.

The Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters tracker, long maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), chronicled major US catastrophes from 1980 to 2024 before it was abruptly shut down in May amid sweeping budget cuts that critics decried as an ideologically driven attack on science.

“This dataset was simply too important to stop being updated, and the demand for its revival came from every sector of society,” Adam Smith, an applied climatologist who helmed the database for 15 years before resigning in May, told AFP.

Among those calling for its return were groups such as the American Academy of Actuaries, who argued the list was a vital tool for tracking the rising costs of climate-fuelled disasters, from wildfires to floods, that threaten homeowners, insurers, and mortgage markets.

Congressional Democrats have also sought to restore the program within NOAA, introducing a bill last month that has yet to advance.

"The European Union’s climate ambitions and its hopes for an industrial revival will come to a head Thursday as the bloc’s 27 leaders meet to chart a way forward – with the clock ticking to set a key emissions goal.

The EU is under pressure to agree on a 10-year target to cut carbon emissions ahead of the United Nations COP30 climate summit next month. But competing concerns over supporting ailing businesses including Europe’s cherished car industry have stalled progress.

“Leaders now have a narrow window to break the deadlock and send a clear signal ahead of COP30,” said Elisa Giannelli, of the E3G climate advocacy group.

Tensions between the EU’s desire to play a starring role in the fight against global warming and boost its sluggish economy have been bubbling up for months.

Many businesses complain they are being asked to invest in greening their operations at a time when trade tensions and competition from China are squeezing returns.

A growing number of capitals, in what is an increasingly right-leaning bloc, have been receptive to industry’s arguments, culminating in a standoff over the headline figure Brussels has put forward to drive its future climate action.
