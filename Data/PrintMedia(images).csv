"'For a country where Gen Z youth peacefully united against a social media ban and later violently protested an internet blackout, it is telling that the new Prime Minister reportedly has no access to the official handles used during the Oli era. 

....Managing digital platforms may seem like a small issue. But it reflects a larger worry about governance, which requires attention to detail, foresight, and institutional capacity. This is especially true in a country where Gen Z youth toppled a government through social media-driven protests, demanding systemic change.

Nepal’s state apparatus quickly needs to figure out how it wants to move forward. If passwords can be lost in transition, what happens to power itself?

"The acting foreign minister of Afghanistan, Amir Khan Muttaqi, will meet External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar Friday, while a meeting with National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval has not been ruled out. The meeting with Jaishankar, will be one where the flag of the Taliban regime, white with the Shahada, will likely not be seen.

The meeting with Jaishankar will be the highest level of interaction between India and Kabul, since the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in August 2021.

Muttaqi arrived in India early Thursday morning, and is set to remain in the country till 15 October, the date the waiver from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) lapses.

"From Rawalpindi chicken tikka masala to Sargodha dal makhani and Bahawalpur naan, the Operation Sindoor-inspired dinner menu of an Indian Air Force (IAF) unit has set off sharp reactions, with some lauding it and others urging the IAF to punch above its weight.

The menu, it is learnt, is from an IAF station that saw intense action in the Western Sector during Operation Sindoor—the 87-hour conflict between India and Pakistan’s armed forces in May. The menu, with dishes named after Pakistan Air Force (PAF) stations and terror camps in Pakistan’s Punjab and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) struck by Indian armed forces, was curated as part of a dinner to mark Air Force Day (8 October).

While this was not officially sanctioned by the IAF, sources in the Indian defence establishment explained that the idea to curate an Operation Sindoor-inspired menu was executed at a local level, in a lighter vein.

"Six years after the ‘Howdy, Modi’ rally in Houston, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump held hands before a cheering crowd, the bonhomie has eroded. And it is the Indian diaspora whose role in influencing India-US relations — or the lack of it — has come under scrutiny. But many who once embodied India’s soft power now defend their perceived passivity, citing “an unprecedented wave of anti-Indian animosity and mistrust.”

Many Indian-Americans sharply criticised Shashi Tharoor’s op-ed in the Indian Express last week, in which he accused them of staying silent on issues such as the 50 per cent tariff of Indian goods and the new six-figure H1-B fee. Yet this is the same community that has long championed the Indian State— building support for the US-India Civil Nuclear Deal in 2008, lobbying to revoke Modi’s visa ban in 2014, and opposing resolutions that sought to condemn India over the abrogation of Article 370.

Now, some have been compelled to put forth a new position: it isn’t their job to criticise the US for its policies toward India.

"'Justice Gavai ascended to the post in an era when social media has hijacked the national dialogue and upper castes have celebrated identity politics. His appointment was not a conscious effort by the government to break caste barriers. He rose to the post by the seniority principle. Hindutva hardliners were far from thrilled that the country’s highest judicial office was now held by a man who is not only Dalit but whose family had abandoned Hinduism for Buddhism. 

...The attacks on the judge went further. On discussion programmes, Hindutva activists managed to recommend violence against him, carefully phrased to stop just short of incitement. Nathuram Godse was invoked (in a good way, of course, given how he is a “hero” in these circles). The idea that Hindu interests were being harmed by the Chief Justice spread rapidly on social media. 

...But neither can he fully disown the hardliners — the ones who propound their own definitions of Sanatan Dharma, hate Muslims and Dalits, venerate Godse, and cheer attacks like the one the Chief Justice was subjected to. They are his original Hindutva base. So when they boast that “the entire system is ours,” he looks the other way.'

"The Prashant Kishor-led Jan Suraaj Party (JSP) has released a list of 51 candidates, including many professionals such as lawyers, doctors, and academicians, for the upcoming Bihar elections.

Former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer R.K. Mishra will contest on a JSP ticket from Darbhanga. IPS R.K. Mishra, a former director general (home guards), served in the police force for a long time and is known for his strict working style. His association with the Jan Suraaj Party is traceable to its inception.

Addressing a press conference, Jan Suraaj Party (JSP) national president Uday Singh said Prashant Kishor will kickstart the poll campaign from Raghopur—a high-profile assembly seat, now represented by the former Bihar deputy chief minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav.

"#WallsOfThePrint — Politics is the beating heart of India. And it has a permanent place on the walls of ThePrint office in central Delhi. These walls are a repository of India’s rich political history, momentous flashes captured by ThePrint’s team of photojournalists led by Praveen Jain.

Story behind the photo: Murli Manohar Joshi’s life could’ve taken a different turn had he not taken the political plunge after doing his doctorate in physics from Allahabad University where he also taught physics. Seen in this photo is a jubilant Joshi, soon after he was sworn in as Minister for Home Affairs in the first Atal Bihari Vajpayee government (16 May - 28 May 1996). Joshi contested his final Lok Sabha election in 2014, before he was ushered into the BJP’s Margdarshak Mandal.

"Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Thursday took a dig at the Samajwadi Party while expressing gratitude towards the current BJP-led government in Uttar Pradesh for maintaining transparency in the management of funds collected from the Kanshi Ram Memorial. 

Speaking at the memorial on the death anniversary of BSP founder Kanshi Ram, Mayawati praised the BJP government for not “suppressing” the revenue generated from visitors.

“We are grateful to the present government because unlike the Samajwadi Party government, the money collected from the people visiting this place has not been suppressed by the present BJP government,” Mayawati said.

"He’s travelled to Paris with India’s Olympic team, started a psychology quiz that drew 12,000 schoolchildren this year, bantered with Ranveer Allahabadia on YouTube, held forth on TV panels, and spoken at dozens of TEDx events. The common thread is mental health. Psychiatrist Dr Samir Parikh has made it his business to get India talking about stigma, social media, and the shortage of professionals in the field. 

With three decades as a psychiatrist and as the chairperson of the Fortis National Mental Health Program, he’s trying to take the subject into schools, homes, and even online. He’s worried about how Indian youth are now juggling many selves—the real self, the ideal self, the role self, and the digital self.
 
“I would not have thought a decade back that I would ever talk about the digital self as a separate self,” said Parikh animatedly at the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences in Fortis Hospital, Gurugram. “It comes with anonymity, with disinhibition, with pressure of comparison, and a lot of incorrect information.”

Addressing the media Thursday, after bilateral talks with Starmer, Modi told the media in Mumbai that a large number of strategic issues were discussed, including the peace process in the Middle East ravaged by the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war and Indo-Pacific security.

Modi said bilateral defence cooperation has grown between the two countries. “We are moving towards defence co-production and connecting the defence industries of both countries.”

"In a recent significant judgment, the Supreme Court has addressed the complex application of Section 149 of the erstwhile Indian Penal Code (IPC) by drawing a distinction between presence and participation to convict those involved in unlawful assembly. 

The Section holds every member of an unlawful assembly (five or more persons) guilty of an offence committed by any member in the prosecution of the assembly’s common object, or for an offence that members knew was likely to be committed.

Additionally, it establishes a form of vicarious liability, wherein an entire group can be held responsible for an individual’s act if it was linked to their shared unlawful purpose.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi Thursday reviewed progress on trade talks with the US in a call with US President Donald Trump. The Prime Minister also welcomed the agreement brokered by Trump to find a way to end the hostilities in Gaza.

This is the second call in the last month between the two leaders after almost three months of silence following a contentious discussion over the role of the US President in halting the conflict between India and Pakistan. The contentious call occurred in June 2025, while Modi was in Canada for the G7 summit.

The partial thaw between India and the US has picked up steam in the last few weeks after Trump wished Modi on the latter’s seventy-fifth birthday in September. That call paved the way for this one, that included discussions on trade. The next US Ambassador to India, Sergio Gor was also confirmed by the Senate earlier in the week and is expected to take up his assignment soon.

"In India, writing about Pakistan’s founding father only creates controversy. But Lord Meghnad Desai’s book, Mohan and Muhammad, looks into the commonalities between the lives and careers of MK Gandhi and Jinnah.

Published three months after the author’s demise, the book intertwines two lives.

“It’s otherwise not easy to do because Mahatma Gandhi sucks all the oxygen out of the room in India. And Muhammad Ali Jinnah, similarly, if he’s on the stage, nobody else can occupy that same pedestal. So it requires someone like Meghnad Desai to bring both these figures into one single frame,” said TCA Raghavan, former ambassador of India to Pakistan, at Delhi’s India International Centre (IIC) on 8 October.

"Delhi’s low-rise flats from the 1970s and 80s didn’t account for their inhabitants growing old. As residents age and become less mobile, lifts have become flashpoints for courtroom battles, neighbour disputes in RWA groups, and bureaucratic deadlock. Car parking was once the main conflict area. Now, the fight is over installing lifts. The DDA’s housing stock never anticipated today’s reality: a car in every home, ageing knees on every floor. Some buildings have basement parking, but only for scooters. And retrofitted lifts are a distant dream for most, even after policy finally made them possible.

Ironically, the system had opened the door just as Nair knocked. In September 2015, the power to issue NOCs for lifts was shifted from the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to local municipal bodies, with the South Corporation even launching a single-window system. Consent letters from just 50 per cent of residents using the common staircase were enough, officials said — the ground floor wasn’t counted. Detailed policy guidelines followed in February 2016. 

...This, even though nearly a decade ago the MCD framed the ‘Detailed Policy for Installation of Lift and Connecting Bridge in Cooperative Group Housing Society (CGHS) Flats and DDA Built Flats (Low Rise Flats) in NCT of Delhi’ — approved by the Lieutenant Governor and based on the DDA’s earlier framework. It laid out procedures for permissions, NOCs, and structural safety, aiming to streamline what was already one of the capital’s most urgent housing challenges.

"Singh held a wide-ranging bilateral meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence of Australia, Richard Marles, in Canberra during his official two-day visit.

The meeting marked five years of the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, with both sides “reaffirming their shared commitment to deepening defence cooperation across a wide spectrum, including military exercises, maritime security, defence industry collaboration and joint research in science and technology,” a statement by the defence ministry said.

As part of his engagements, a live air-to-air refuelling demonstration was held onboard the KC-30A Multirole Transport and Tanker Aircraft (MRTT), refuelling an F-35 aircraft en route to Canberra. It showcased a demonstration of growing interoperability following last year’s Implementation Arrangement on Air-to-Air Refuelling between the two countries.
