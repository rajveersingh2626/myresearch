"Did India just have Pakistan for dinner ? Metaphorically, if not literally- this meme is now viral, shared across social media by top military veterans and ordinary citizens alike to mark Air Force Day! The menu is most likely the work of a creative imagination. The Air Force has not given any indication that this was an actual or real menu at the special celebrations but someone with a great sense of humour wrote up a shareable menu nevertheless! Dishes were named after Pakistan’s airbases bombed during #OperationSindoor. From “Rawalpindi Chicken Tikka Masala” to “Muridke Meetha Pan,” the witty “menu” , even if a meme, sparked laughter and pride across social media

"The most heartbreaking part of speaking to the father of Baby Fatima, all of 8 months old , when a killer cough syrup Coldrif, poisoned her and 22 other children - is how lost and helpless he sounded. “Im a small man,”, he said , “Who can I get angry with?” - but we should all be angry and very very angry for him and for 22 children, all under five killed by a cough syrup that had a toxic chemical ( DEG) forty six percent above the legal level of 0.1%-. As far as I am concerned, this is murder, manslaughter at the very least - not an accident. And like always it’s the poor of our country who are the hardest hit. This is the story of the youngest victim of the killer cough syrup scam - 8 month old Sehraish Ali Fatima was playing with her father on the night of September 22nd, when she suddenly fell ill. Like all fathers of baby girls, he doted on her, and had big dreams for her - he wanted her to be a doctor. But, what happened after her sudden illness overnight is a tragedy that no one could have possibly imagined in their wildest nightmares. Baby Fatima died soon after falling ill, post her being prescribed the killer #coughsyrup - #Coldrif. This cough syrup has destroyed several homes in Chhindwara, #MadhyaPradesh - where 22 kids, all under the age of five, have died after taking this cough syrup. Even as the manufacturer is arrested, the anguished but stoic father of Fatima - Sayyad Ali says who should he get angry at? His daughter was taken from him, so now all he has is sadness for the rest of his life. Will heads roll? Or will more parents have to resign to this absolutely heart wrenching fate.

"India on Tuesday joined Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, and several Central Asian nations in opposing U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to regain control of the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan.

In a joint statement, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and the Taliban government in Kabul termed as “unacceptable” any attempt by foreign powers to redeploy military infrastructure in Afghanistan or its neighbouring regions.

India was represented at the Moscow meeting by its Ambassador, Vinay Kumar, while the Taliban’s Acting Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also participated. Notably, Muttaqi is visiting India for the first time starting today.

For decades, the Bagram airbase has served as a strategic hub for successive foreign powers operating in Afghanistan. Watch our explainer to understand its geopolitical importance and why New Delhi aligned itself with this position.

"A historic moment in Middle East diplomacy — world leaders have reacted to U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of an agreement between Israel and Hamas on the first phase of his Gaza peace plan, marking a major step towards ending the two-year-long war in the enclave.

From Australia’s Anthony Albanese to Britain’s Keir Starmer, Canada’s Global Affairs, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, messages of relief and cautious optimism poured in. Albanese hailed the deal as a “much-needed step towards peace,” while Starmer called it “a profound moment of relief for hostages and civilians.” Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu termed it “a big day for Israel,” thanking Trump and IDF forces, whereas Hamas appreciated efforts by mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, urging all sides to honour the terms.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi also welcomed the breakthrough, reaffirming India’s support for peace, stability, and the two-state solution. Trump described the day as “historic and unprecedented,” praising all mediators who helped broker the deal.

"A public health tragedy has unfolded in different states of India. 20 children have died after consuming cough syrups in Madhya Pradesh. At least nine more children remain on life support with failing kidneys. Tests have found dangerously high levels of diethylene glycol in syrups such as Coldrif, ReLife, and Respifresh TR. This echoes past tragedies like the 2020 Coldbest PC deaths in Jammu & Kashmir, highlighting systemic regulatory failures. In Madhya Pradesh, the burden has been shifted to the Doctor who prescribed the syrup. However, the Indian Medical Association has posed a valid question: How can a doctor possibly know that a cough syrup is contaminated? Shouldn’t the accountability fall on regulators and, most importantly, the company that manufactured these syrups? While several states have moved to ban these syrups, it appears to be too late for many victims. How many more children must die before the government wakes up and enforces safety measures?

"A dramatic midnight operation in Chennai led to the arrest of Ranganathan Govindan, owner of Sresan Pharmaceuticals, the firm behind the Coldrif cough syrup linked to the deaths of 22 children in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The toxic syrup was found to contain diethylene glycol, a lethal chemical far beyond safe limits. Police tracked Ranganathan for days before finally catching him around 1:30 am. He faces charges of culpable homicide and adulteration, as investigations widen across states.

"Bollywood icon Deepika Padukone is being trolled online after she appeared wearing a hijab and abaya in a new Abu Dhabi tourism ad with husband Ranveer Singh. The couple, recently announced as brand ambassadors for Experience Abu Dhabi, can be seen exploring the city’s landmarks — including the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, where Deepika covers her head as a mark of respect.

The clip sparked outrage among some social media users who accused her of “appeasement” and questioned her choice of attire. However, her fans quickly stepped in, explaining that every woman visiting the mosque — irrespective of religion — is required to cover her head. “As Indians, we should not show insecurity about everything,” one fan wrote, while another pointed out, “She did the same at temples in India. It’s about respect, not religion.

Many called the trolling baseless, praising Deepika for her grace and cultural sensitivity. “She looks regal, respectful, and proud,” a fan shared. Others applauded her global representation, saying, “This is how you respect every culture beautifully.”
