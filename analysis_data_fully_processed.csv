MensXP,Entertainment,"Their day begins in dust, defined by grit, grunts, and grabs. Yet the moment they step off the mat, the story changes. The Haryana Steelers carry a fierce attitude, yet layer it with something new: a modern swagger that mirrors hip hop beats, street fashion silhouettes, and the unapologetic rhythm of Haryanvi rap. They are proof that champions can be more than muscle - they can shape identity, influence style, and shift conversations.

No posturing, no hesitation - just athletes who looked as comfortable in PUMA fits as they do in akharas, their masculinity now speaking in a new vocabulary: one of edge, elegance, and aspiration.

This is kabaddi, reimagined. Strength recast as style. Tradition in conversation with swagger. Athletes who move like icons, and icons who still wear their scars with pride.

MensXP,Entertainment,"Growth, when it’s real, is rarely loud. 

It doesn’t always come wrapped in applause or algorithms. Sometimes, it arrives in the quiet — in the distance one puts between performance and authenticity. 

For @puravjha that distance has been transformative. Once the boy with effortless timing and memeable charm, he now stands at a more deliberate crossroads: one where craft takes precedence over clout, and narrative over noise. 

In a creator economy obsessed with reinvention, his evolution is refreshingly unforced. It isn’t a departure from the past — but a deeper reckoning with selfhood. 

With this MensXP cover, we don’t just meet a digital star. We meet a young man reclaiming his voice, rethinking his trajectory, and reimagining what it means to take up space with intention.

This is Purav Jha. Not rebranded — but redefined. Coming Into His Own.

PrintMedia(images),Political,"'For a country where Gen Z youth peacefully united against a social media ban and later violently protested an internet blackout, it is telling that the new Prime Minister reportedly has no access to the official handles used during the Oli era. 

....Managing digital platforms may seem like a small issue. But it reflects a larger worry about governance, which requires attention to detail, foresight, and institutional capacity. This is especially true in a country where Gen Z youth toppled a government through social media-driven protests, demanding systemic change.

Nepal’s state apparatus quickly needs to figure out how it wants to move forward. If passwords can be lost in transition, what happens to power itself?

PrintMedia(images),Political,"From Rawalpindi chicken tikka masala to Sargodha dal makhani and Bahawalpur naan, the Operation Sindoor-inspired dinner menu of an Indian Air Force (IAF) unit has set off sharp reactions, with some lauding it and others urging the IAF to punch above its weight.

The menu, it is learnt, is from an IAF station that saw intense action in the Western Sector during Operation Sindoor—the 87-hour conflict between India and Pakistan’s armed forces in May. The menu, with dishes named after Pakistan Air Force (PAF) stations and terror camps in Pakistan’s Punjab and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) struck by Indian armed forces, was curated as part of a dinner to mark Air Force Day (8 October).

While this was not officially sanctioned by the IAF, sources in the Indian defence establishment explained that the idea to curate an Operation Sindoor-inspired menu was executed at a local level, in a lighter vein.

PrintMedia(images),Political,"Six years after the ‘Howdy, Modi’ rally in Houston, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump held hands before a cheering crowd, the bonhomie has eroded. And it is the Indian diaspora whose role in influencing India-US relations — or the lack of it — has come under scrutiny. But many who once embodied India’s soft power now defend their perceived passivity, citing “an unprecedented wave of anti-Indian animosity and mistrust.”

Many Indian-Americans sharply criticised Shashi Tharoor’s op-ed in the Indian Express last week, in which he accused them of staying silent on issues such as the 50 per cent tariff of Indian goods and the new six-figure H1-B fee. Yet this is the same community that has long championed the Indian State— building support for the US-India Civil Nuclear Deal in 2008, lobbying to revoke Modi’s visa ban in 2014, and opposing resolutions that sought to condemn India over the abrogation of Article 370.

Now, some have been compelled to put forth a new position: it isn’t their job to criticise the US for its policies toward India.

His appointment was not a conscious effort by the government to break caste barriers. He rose to the post by the seniority principle. Hindutva hardliners were far from thrilled that the country’s highest judicial office was now held by a man who is not only Dalit but whose family had abandoned Hinduism for Buddhism. 

...The attacks on the judge went further. On discussion programmes, Hindutva activists managed to recommend violence against him, carefully phrased to stop just short of incitement. Nathuram Godse was invoked (in a good way, of course, given how he is a “hero” in these circles). The idea that Hindu interests were being harmed by the Chief Justice spread rapidly on social media. 

...But neither can he fully disown the hardliners — the ones who propound their own definitions of Sanatan Dharma, hate Muslims and Dalits, venerate Godse, and cheer attacks like the one the Chief Justice was subjected to. They are his original Hindutva base. So when they boast that “the entire system is ours,” he looks the other way.'

“It’s otherwise not easy to do because Mahatma Gandhi sucks all the oxygen out of the room in India.

PrintMedia(images),Political,"Delhi’s low-rise flats from the 1970s and 80s didn’t account for their inhabitants growing old. As residents age and become less mobile, lifts have become flashpoints for courtroom battles, neighbour disputes in RWA groups, and bureaucratic deadlock. Car parking was once the main conflict area. Now, the fight is over installing lifts. The DDA’s housing stock never anticipated today’s reality: a car in every home, ageing knees on every floor. Some buildings have basement parking, but only for scooters. And retrofitted lifts are a distant dream for most, even after policy finally made them possible.

Ironically, the system had opened the door just as Nair knocked. In September 2015, the power to issue NOCs for lifts was shifted from the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to local municipal bodies, with the South Corporation even launching a single-window system. Consent letters from just 50 per cent of residents using the common staircase were enough, officials said — the ground floor wasn’t counted. Detailed policy guidelines followed in February 2016. 

...This, even though nearly a decade ago the MCD framed the ‘Detailed Policy for Installation of Lift and Connecting Bridge in Cooperative Group Housing Society (CGHS) Flats and DDA Built Flats (Low Rise Flats) in NCT of Delhi’ — approved by the Lieutenant Governor and based on the DDA’s earlier framework. It laid out procedures for permissions, NOCs, and structural safety, aiming to streamline what was already one of the capital’s most urgent housing challenges.

TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“I’ve always called myself a banjara, a wanderer. My life has been less of a straight and narrow road, and more of a winding journey through mountains and valleys.

It wasn’t me who found storytelling. It was storytelling that found me.

It happened by accident – one reel, one story, on “Agar Tum Saath Ho.” I just sat down and spoke. That video reached nearly 30 million people. Overnight, my life had a rhythm, a purpose.

But before that? I was searching. I changed eleven different professions – investment banking, working in factories, waiting tables in cafés, trying my hand at startups. Ironic that everyone always says don’t give up, because I say the opposite – give up as many times as you need, until you find the one thing that makes you wake up with a smile. For me, that smile came with stories.

I credit the day I watched the film Tamasha. Watching Ranbir on screen felt like watching myself – restless, out of place, aching for meaning. The next morning, I quit my job. People called me impulsive. But to me, the bigger risk felt like staying in a place I didn’t belong.

Life has honestly tested me many times. I was born with one hand. As a child, I’d hide it in photographs, shrink into corners, try to disappear. Kids can be cruel, and their words cut deep. But my parents gave me a different lens: I was not incomplete. I was a limited-edition piece in a world of mass production. Their love and faith changed the way I saw myself.
Once storytelling entered my life, it began to open up. I wrote three books. I stood on stages across the world. I sat across from Aamir Khan. I even worked with Imtiaz Ali – the man whose film pushed me to leap into the unknown. Meeting him felt like life had drawn a perfect circle.

But the truth is, I’m still wandering. Still moving. Still surrendering. Because a banjara never really arrives. He just carries stories from one place to another, hoping they find the people who need them most.
For me, that’s enough. Always has been. Always will be.”

TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“I’d always known Akash as the neighbourhood guy who played football – the boy I’d see running around the society ground. 

I moved away for work in 2012, but when the pandemic hit, life brought me back to Kolkata. With the world shut down, my mornings were spent running to stay fit. One morning, I injured my knee while running. Akash helped me, and we started talking – from small tips on training… to long conversations that went beyond the field. I was 32. He was 23.

Three months before that, he’d told me he had a crush on me. Maine uss baat ko seriously nahi liya tha. But Akash? He was certain about his feelings – that certainty changed everything.

We started chatting daily – morning runs, walks after dinner, running errands. Flirting toh bahot karta tha yeh. He’d always tease me, “We’re like Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas.” Over time, our relationship blossomed.

One day my mother got hold of a letter that he’d written for me. All hell broke loose. Our homes erupted in fights. My mother often cried. “What will people say?” “He has not even started earning.” “Will his family accept you?”

Despite all the arguments, I knew she wanted the best for me. I told her, “I earn enough to take care of us both for now. He makes me happy, isn’t that what counts?” After 6 months, she finally accepted us. 

It’s been 5 years to that. We got married in January this year. No one from Akash’s family attended the wedding. My father also refused to come. But we were confident in our love, and carried on. 

Today, life with Akash is better than my dreams. Our weekends are movies and cooking together, sometimes spontaneous road trips. He got me hooked on travelling!

Of course, we still get the taunts. “She married him, so he’ll take care of her in old age.” Online, it’s worse. Funnily enough, nobody would have batted an eye if Akash was the older one.

But age doesn’t guarantee happiness. I realised that when couples from all over India started sending us DMs after watching our reels – sharing how our story gave them courage.

Even our families have started coming around. At the end of the day, age or society doesn’t sustain a relationship. Love does.”",80705,1006,2351999,106236.99,0.20250540058232366,0.4485723678031369,4.717891260162602
TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“The first time I saw Ram Leela was in 1974, I was 23. I lived near Raj Bhavan, & every evening I would hear the chants, the crowd & felt compelled to walk towards Girgaon Chowpatty to watch. The Ram Leela I saw back then was organised by Shree Adarsh Ramlila Samiti. At that time, I was a guest.

In 1985, I joined the same Samiti as a member & today, I serve as the Hon. Secretary & Trustee. Over the decades, I have seen Ram Leela evolve. In the 70s, there was no TV or digital streaming. If you wanted to experience the magic, you had to be present in the crowd. Nearly 3,000 people gathered every evening. Today, people can watch it online, so the crowds have thinned. Yet the excitement, the energy & the spirit of Dussehra night remain unchanged. Families still bring their kids, just as they did 50 years ago.

For me, two moments stand out every year. The first is Dussehra night, when the 60ft effigy of Ravana is set aflame before lacs of people. That effigy is built by Muslim artisans who travel yearly from Noida. Watching it burn reminds us that no matter how times change, good will always triumph over evil.

The second moment is the Raj Tilak, the coronation of Ram. As the darbar is recreated on stage, it feels like truth itself has been restored. This finale, brought alive by the Ram Mandali from Mathura, ties the entire story together.

What makes this possible are the people: the members, the artisans, the mandali. Over the years, I’ve been blessed to work with people of shared values – our General Secretary Mr. Rajendra Agarwal, Anil P. Agarwal, Vaibhav Gupta, Kailash Agarwal, Ghanshyam Pehalajani, Rajesh Jhunjhunwala & all our team members. Together, we’ve given our time, devotion & hearts to keep Ram Leela alive.

People ask me about the challenges of organising something this big. I always say that when it is Ramji’s work, he takes care of the problems.

For 62 years, our Samiti has carried this tradition forward. Even in today’s age, nothing compares to being here in person; shoulder to shoulder with thousands, watching the story unfold. Because Ram Leela is not just a play. It is our heritage, a living reminder that good will always conquer evil.”",1981,9,57282,2571.82,0.042499999999999996,0.4408333333333333,6.674429319371729
TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"(2/2) TW: Rape
“The day of 9th December felt like running through fire. The FIR was registered, and my medical examination, my statement, the photographs – every step felt like reliving it all over again.
The police confiscated from Akash’s flat – the bedsheet, hair strands, my undergarments – reminders that this really happened. Mustafa and Akash were arrested on the same day, but Mohsin absconded. The court proceedings began, and the police found a photo on Mustafa’s phone taken that night. It showed me in bed, barely covered. Proof of what he’d done. His bail was rejected.
But Akash argued that, since there were no injuries found on my private parts, although there were injuries on the rest of my body, that the act was consensual between Mustafa and I. He even asked for leniency as he was supposed to get married on 1st of March. His bail was approved.
I felt shattered. We immediately applied for a cancellation of bail. For months, I stood in hearings, hoping to get some justice. There were days when Akash stood right next to me – free – despite his heinous crime.
I remember when they finally arrested Mohsin, the relief I felt, and the subsequent trauma when I had to identify him in a line-up. His beard and hair had changed, but I recognised him the moment I saw him. His presence made my skin crawl. I knew I had to face him, face them all, if I wanted justice.
Since that night, I’ve moved back home. Quit my thriving career in Mumbai. The girl who once built visual worlds through special effects now struggles to close her eyes. Sleep doesn’t come easy. Panic attacks do. I don’t go out. Some nights, I wake up gasping for air.
It’s been almost a year. The first step of trial – framing of charges – hasn’t even begun.
I don’t want sympathy. I want accountability. This is not just about me. It’s about every woman who’s trusted an old friend, or ever been told to stay silent, to forgive, to move on. Speaking out is the first step towards justice. I hope I reach the day it finally prevails.”

“I’d known one of them for ten years. I met Mustafa Rangoonwala in college, and we kept in touch, often talking about work and life. He’d even met my family, and gone on vacations with us. I trusted him as a friend. On the night of 8th December, 2024, we decided, ‘It’s been too long, let’s catch up.’
That evening, I reached the restaurant at 7:30 pm. He wasn’t alone – he’d come with a friend, Akash Bindu. I remember thinking, ‘That’s fine… maybe it’ll just be a longer dinner.’ We ordered drinks. We talked about old times. When it was close to 11 pm, Mustafa said, ‘Let’s go to my place for another drink.’ I said no. His friend offered his own flat instead, as it was close by. They both insisted. I gave in.
At the flat, I met another one of their friends, Mohsin Khan. By this point, I was feeling tipsy, and my head was hurting. That’s when Mustafa handed me a glass of something – it wasn’t colourless. When I asked what it was, he said, ‘It’ll help with your headache.’ I remember that moment so vividly because it was the last time the world felt normal.
After that, everything became fragments. Hands pulling my phone away. My wrists tied. The sound of my own breath, shallow and panicked. The pressure of a palm over my mouth halting my screams. The weight of betrayal that crushed the air out of me. 
All three men raped me that night.
Around 3:30am, I begged them to let me go, and promised I wouldn’t tell anyone what had happened. Mustafa threatened me to stay quiet or face the consequences – to my life. He walked me to the elevator himself – as if nothing had happened. Downstairs, I got into a rickshaw, went to a friend’s place, and called my parents in Pune. I couldn’t stop crying. I still remember their voices – cracking with fear and disbelief as they said, ‘We’re coming to Mumbai right now.’
I was too scared and ashamed to go to the police. I thought I’d done something wrong, that I’d be blamed and judged. But it was my Mama, who’d accompanied my parents, who convinced me, ‘Beta, you’re not the one in the wrong, you shouldn’t stay silent. You deserve justice, we’ll do whatever it takes…’”

TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“People often ask me, ‘Aren’t you scared, stepping into a cage full of blood, men, and fighters twice your age?’ But the truth is, I’ve never been scared. Only curious.

I grew up in Kolgaon, Maharashtra. My childhood was simple: books, farms, discipline. I was a shy child, but always restless, always moving.

One summer, when I was 10, my dad, who has a karate background, took me to a CrossFit gym. I was looking around, all curious, and the coach asked me, ‘Want to learn grappling & jiu-jitsu?’ I was confused at first, but once he explained what it meant, I immediately said yes.

Soon, I was training with men twice my size. Ten days later, I entered a championship. But I was told I’d won because there were no girls in my category. I could have walked away with the medal. But I wanted to fight. They put me against a boy, older and heavier. Everyone thought I’d back out. But I fought. And won.

For the first time I realised, this sport isn’t about strength, it’s about willpower. Since then, I’ve stepped into cages against women twice my age. In Shillong, I fought a 30-year-old national champion. The crowd cheered for her. But by the end, when my hand was raised victorious, they screamt my name.

It isn’t easy. My days begin at 8 AM in the gym, and often end past midnight after training camps. No sugar, no fried, just home-cooked meals with 12 cheat days in a year.

What keeps me going is my family. My mom plans every meal, my dad never misses a fight. He leaves behind his work to travel with me. My late grandfather would proudly send videos of my wins to the entire family. Today, I fight with his voice echoing in my mind, telling me how proud he is.

Of course, there are losses, injuries, and disappointments. But even in defeat, people come up to me and say, ‘We’ve never seen a 16-year-old fight like this.’ That’s enough to remind me why I do this.

My dream is to one day be the UFC World Champion. But more than that, to inspire other young girls. To prove that courage has no age, no gender, no boundaries.

Because the moment that cage locks behind me, it’s not about who’s standing across. It’s about me, my grit, and my belief that I’m exactly where I belong.”",2382,66,56594,3079.94,0.06018518518518518,0.5200176366843032,4.557487289269471
TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“People often ask me, ‘What was life like as a woman in uniform?’

I always go back to where it began. I was born in a fauji home where olive green wasn’t just a colour, it was a legacy. My great-grandfather, father, uncles, cousins — all served. Service before self wasn’t a motto; it was a way of life.

At a very young age, I lost my father while he was on duty. Overnight, Maa became both parents. She could’ve relied on my father’s dues, but instead, she built a business from scratch & kept our world moving forward.

In 2008, when I sat for the 4 Air Force Selection Board; the one exam you get just a single shot at, I heard her voice echo, ‘Sapne itne bade dekho, aasman bhi chhota pad jaaye.’
Out of over a hundred candidates, only one made it through that year — me. That’s how I earned my blues & took to the skies as a helicopter pilot.

Training was brutal. 4 a.m. wake-ups, drills, simulators, sorties. There were days I thought of quitting. But Maa reminded me, ‘That’s not the girl I raised.’

For 14 years, I flew missions that tested me. Flood relief in the Northeast, tactical evacuations in hostile zones. Once, we airlifted a wounded jawan in stormy weather, his blood pooling on the floor while my instruments blinked warnings.
In that moment, I realised courage isn’t the absence of fear; it’s the resolve to stay steady despite it.

There were sacrifices too. While friends explored life, I was flying sorties. Later, as a wife to a fighter pilot & mother of two, I learned to balance night flights with bedtime stories. Some days, I broke down. But I always rose back because I had my family, my purpose, my uniform.

After 14 years of service, I hung up my blues. People say I left the Air Force — I say, I gave my best years to my country, & then chose to reinvent. I pursued an MBA, won the title of Voguestar Mrs. India 2024, & today, I lead recruitment at Capgemini.

Because women don’t have to be just one thing.
We can guard our skies & walk the ramp.
We can carry a bleeding soldier to safety & rock a baby to sleep.

TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“‘Goa jaana hai!’ That’s what Priya said when she told us about her bachelorette. Sakshi and I jumped in immediately because none of us had ever been to Goa! But when we told our parents, the answer was a clear no.

‘Goa is not safe.’
‘Celebrate here in Indore.’
‘Why go so far?’

We even contemplated lying and sneaking out. But then, randomly, an idea popped into my head, ‘Why not take our moms with us?’ At first, everyone laughed. But then it clicked, our moms had never been on such a trip either!

Cut to: three daughters, three moms, landing in Goa for a bachelorette. People looked at us like, ‘Is this for real?’

We went kayaking. We danced at Thalassa while our moms blushed at the belly dancers. One night, we threw a proper bachelorette for Priya, our moms joined for a bit, cheering and laughing, before leaving us three to dance the night away.

But the best part wasn’t the rides or the parties. It was seeing a side of our moms we’d never seen before. They were carefree, giggling like schoolgirls, eating ice cream by the beach, bargaining like pros at flea markets. It made us think, this is the girlhood they never got to experience. The things we take for granted today are still so novel to them. For once, they were free, with no inhibitions.

Somewhere in the middle of the trip, my mom got emotional. She said, ‘I’ve never even travelled for my honeymoon. This is the best trip of my life.’ I can still hear her voice in my head when I think about it.

TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“I was born in a poor house, so poor where even knowing your birth date was a privilege. I was around nine or ten when my father passed away. To support my family, I took a job at a tent cinema.

I watched every film, memorizing the songs. Music fascinated me, especially the trumpet. By coincidence, a band practiced near our house. Whenever a new song was released, they’d rehearse it tirelessly – taking a week to master it.

One day, I told the band leader, “You’re taking too long to learn,” and suggested faster methods. Instead of a “thank you”, I got a slap and a harsh reminder not to question my elders.

That lit a fire in me. I ran to my brother, and told him everything. He scolded me for interfering, and then asked, “Do you really want to play the trumpet?” I shouted, “Yes, and I’ll play the songs they’re practicing in front of him!” That’s how I got my first trumpet. I couldn’t afford lessons; it was hard enough to have two meals a day. I practiced endlessly until I finally earned through music.

Eventually, I got married, had children, and began performing at events in Mumbai and Pune. Years of playing eventually led to asthma, yet the joy and laughter of children when I performed at their birthdays made it worthwhile. But soon, the course of my life changed.

Within four years, I lost four family members. First, my grandson and one of my sons, in separate accidents. Then, my wife suffered a heart attack; she took her last breath on a bus we were on. Not long after, I lost my granddaughter, 15 days before her wedding. One moment she complained of a headache; the next, I was preparing for her last rites.

Their medical bills left me with a debt of 25 lacs, with no way to repay it. I even grew to hate the instrument that once fed my family. But one day, someone uploaded one of my performances online. The video received immense love, and people stepped up to help. 

Today, I’ve cleared around 8-9 lacs of my debt. I won’t stop until I’ve paid it all off. So, I continue, with my trumpet in one hand and the need to protect my remaining family in another.”

The memories of those nights in detention make my hands tremble. On Sep 8th, during a routine immigration check-in, I was told I was under arrest. My granddaughter was waiting outside. They let me call her once. I said, ‘Beta, go home… they’ve arrested me.’ She cried, thinking she’d done something wrong.

I was kept in a cold room all night – no chairs, just a metal bench. When I asked for a pillow or blanket, I was given a dirty foil sheet. When they moved me, they cuffed my hands & legs. I could barely climb into the van. I wasn’t given my medicines. The first week, they served only meat. I kept saying I was vegetarian, but they didn’t care. I survived on chips & biscuits until Sep 14th, when I got my first veg meal. I felt like my life didn’t matter.

I arrived to the USA in ’92 with my sons, who became citizens through marriage, & applied for asylum myself. My final appeal was denied in 2012, but I never went underground. For 13 years, I reported to immigration & followed every rule.

Life there was good. I worked 6 days a week, & helped care for my grandchildren. I’d drop my grandsons to school & pick them up; made sure they studied. They were closer to me than their parents. When they heard I’d been taken, they were devastated. They still ask, ‘Kya karoge aap, Dadi?’

While I was in detention, my family acted quickly. My lawyer reached out to the Indian Consulate & discovered that, all these years, ICE never formally submitted a request for my travel documents. Within days, they were issued, & my lawyer booked my flight to India. They asked that I be released into family custody to say my goodbyes & leave with dignity. ICE ignored them, & moved me to the final location – Georgia.

TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“When you’re born different, people quietly decide what you can and cannot have. Love was supposed to be out of reach for me. Until Hema walked into my life.

I was born in 1969 in Talala, Gir. At the age of two, an incorrect injection left me unable to walk. My childhood was spent between hospitals and treatments. But even when my body gave up, my spirit didn’t. At our ancestral temple, I’d listen to bhajans and kirtans. When I sang or played the harmonium, people danced around me. That gave me courage, and at 20, I moved to Baroda to study music.

That year, at the Ellora garba, I noticed two girls in the crowd. They didn’t just dance, they sang every word. On the third night, when our chorus singers lost their voices, I suggested we call those girls on stage. That’s how I met Hema.

For the remaining nights, we sang together, and so did our hearts. We fell in love. She belonged to a wealthy Mistry family, I was a Brahmin boy in a wheelchair. Ironically, it wasn’t her family who questioned our match, it was mine – because of caste. Her father, instead, looked at me and said, ‘Ye ladka patthar se bhi paani nikal sakta hai.’

After a year of courtship, we made a bold choice. On a 50 rupee stamp paper, we wrote that we wanted no share of property–all we wanted were blessings–and we got married. We had nothing, just a rented house and days when food was scarce. But Hema always stood by me.

When she got pregnant with our son, Daivat, my family finally softened, and accepted our love. Years later, our second boy, Maharshi, was born. We decided to raise our children with one belief – give them the freedom to choose their own path, but let them know they are always loved. However busy life was, we ended the day together at the dinner table. Today, our children are grown, we are grandparents, and that table is still where the love lives.

Life gave me milestones. Tours abroad, compositions and songs for Modi ji, even a Guinness World Record. But nothing compares to what Hema and I built together. When I look back at 35 years of marriage, I realise music gave me more than a career. It gave me Hema. My partner, my family, my greatest composition of all.”",5653,78,0,5809.0,0.24855072463768116,0.47608695652173916,5.341235294117649
TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“Every year, I climb a ladder to place Maa Durga’s mukut on the idol in the courtyard. Even today, my hands tremble a little. Because in that moment, I feel the weight of two centuries of tradition resting on me.

Our story began eight generations ago in Dhamua, Bengal. My ancestor’s father moved to Calcutta as a purohit, and his son, Girish Mukherjee, after whom our house ‘Girish Bhavan’ is named, became a successful lawyer – he even handled cases for royals. But beyond his profession, what he left behind was a legacy that defines us even today: the Durga Puja and Jagadhatri Puja at our home. Ma Jagadhatri became our household deity, worshipped every day of the year, and Durga Puja became the festival that brought us together as a family.

Preparations start months in advance. For the Puja, 53 of us gather under one roof. Everyone has a role. My elder brother recites mantras from a 200-year-old pothi with the guru, another conducts the havan, and my mother and aunts carefully manage mithai, nariyal, flowers, and utensils that are only used during this time.

As a child, I watched from the sidelines. Puja meant hanging out with cousins and the joy of seeing the house come alive. But after my sacred thread ceremony, I stepped into the rituals myself. I learned all I could from my elders.

Even the making of the idol carries meaning. A small portion of punya maati, soil from a sex worker’s home, is always mixed into the clay. It is not unique to us, but it symbolizes something profound: the goddess accepts everyone.

Then, there are some rituals that are special to our family. On Dashami, the boys walk in a circle around our Bandhuta space, just as my father and grandfather once did. 

My fondest memories, though, are of the little things: early morning conversations with cousins before the crowds arrive, evenings filled with traditional Bengali songs, & the Dashami meal we share after visarjan, all together.

At the end of every Puja, as we look around at one another, the thought is always the same: 198 years later, Durga Puja is not just about rituals. It is about family, togetherness, and the strength of a tradition that each generation chooses to keep alive.""",6733,51,91974,7754.74,0.06889880952380953,0.5473214285714286,9.050320366132723
TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“My name is Aanya, I’m 5 years old, and I’ve loved dancing for as long as I can remember!

I started before anyone officially taught me. When the TV was on, I would enact the dances on the screen. Once, when I was 2, at a family wedding, a choreographer said I was too small so he didn’t include me in the performances. But I still picked up all the steps just by sitting in one corner and watching. On the sangeet night, when I started performing below the stage, people stopped looking there and started watching me instead. That’s when my parents realised – dancing wasn’t just fun for me, it was something special.

People would constantly tell them to share my photos and videos, so they created an Instagram account where family and friends could enjoy my performances. But then one reel went viral, and suddenly, millions of people were watching. That’s when dancing became a part of our everyday lives.

It’s not just my journey anymore – it’s my whole family’s. My Mumma designs my costumes, and helps me practice. My Papa shoots and edits my videos. Earlier, they had to manage their own work and wouldn’t stay at home so much, but now, I get to spend everyday all the time with them! We even go for late-night drives, juice stops, and monthly trips where it’s just us and no social media.

At first, when I started gaining attention online, my parents were worried. People said, ‘She’s too young, don’t overexpose her.’ But so many more sent love, saying, ‘She’s just a little girl dancing her heart out. Let her do what she wants.’ That made us so happy, and we kept going!

I’ve had the chance to dance with my favourite stars, like Nora Didi! And I keep watching Shraddha Didi’s movies again and again, and dancing to her songs. But this doesn’t mean I don’t focus on my studies. I want to be a good student, so I can grow up and be a doctor! For now though, I just want to keep dancing… because it makes me happy, it makes everyone around me smile, and it brings my family closer together.”",71178,254,981420,81500.2,0.23582057823129254,0.48543792517006795,6.272059016393445
TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“I grew up dancing because of my elder sister. She was an actress, always on stage, & she introduced me to Garba. Watching her perform inspired me. Even when I followed the expected path – engineering, & a coding job, I never left dance behind. After office, I would rush to my tiny studio in Borivali & teach. For years, I lived with each foot straddling both worlds.

By 26, I realised I had to choose. I wanted a shot at my dream – if it didn’t work out, I could always return to a job. Quitting felt risky, but my parents encouraged me, ‘If you want to try, do it now.’ That’s when I met Parth, who in no time became a friend, a brother, and a business partner.

That’s how Thangaat Garba was born. The start wasn’t easy. People believed no one would pay to learn Garba. To change that, we hosted free workshops. Every hall filled up, proving there was untapped love waiting to be channelled. Then came a turning point. During one of her Navratri promotional tours, Falguni Pathak visited our class. I knew then this could be something big.

From 4 instructors managing back-to-back sessions, today we’re a team of 180 across 45 locations in 12 cities, workshoping in 8 countries. Along the way, Garba gave me my life partner. I met my wife Shikha during one of our online sessions, & our chats quickly turned into shared plans & dreams. Since then, we’ve been growing together, in dance & in life.

The journey takes us places we never imagined. Last year, after a workshop in New York, our students asked if we could celebrate by dancing at Times Square. For 15 minutes, Garba lit up the heart of the city. Strangers clapped along, some asked what dance this was, & Garba travelled beyond our community.

It still feels surreal when a student says, ‘I love Garba more than hip-hop.’ Every time I think of how far we’ve come, I go back to that first visit from Falguni ji. Just last night, I was at a Garba where she introduced us to her team. Years ago, we were nervously introducing ourselves to her. Coming full circle reminded me it wasn’t just about dance. It’s about a culture crossing borders, from Borivali to Times Square & beyond.”",17053,194,328273,20723.73,0.18265151515151518,0.49522727272727274,5.622991305774281
TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"In 2019, my friend Abi and I went to a garba night here in Australia. We didn’t know a single step, we just stood there watching people’s feet. But in the last 20 mins, I told her, “We came here to dance, let’s do it!” The moment I joined in…I was hooked.

Honestly, dance had always been a part of my life. As a teenager, I trained in jazz, tap, ballet & contemporary. I even danced professionally. But then life took over, & amidst my marriage, children, and work… dancing took a backseat. Years later, Bollywood movies rekindled that spark. They were like musical theatre on screen – songs, emotions, dance all woven together. I’d spend hours in my lounge room, rewinding scenes and learning routines. That love eventually led me to a Bollywood dance studio in Perth, where I met Maitri, who’s from Mumbai. She taught us different formats, & somehow, garba entered my life.

That studio is also where I bonded with Abi, and for years, both of us dreamt of going to India to celebrate Navratri. The pandemic delayed our plans, but last October, we finally made it. We landed in Mumbai, joined Maitri and her sister, Hasshruti’s group, and lived out our dream.

It was nothing short of magical. The energy, the music, the sea of people, was overwhelming at first. But once I stepped in, it felt like a prayer. One night at Falgunī Pathak’s show, the sky opened up. Rain poured, thunder roared, fireworks lit up the night. Yet, everyone kept dancing. I was drenched, breathless, and yet, I’d never felt more alive. It was spiritual, like the universe itself had joined us.

People came up to me and said, “Thank you for embracing our culture.” But the truth is, I was the grateful one. To be welcomed, to belong, even as an outsider from Perth, was the real gift.

That’s what inspired me to bring this beautiful culture back home – I’m celebrating Navratri in Australia this year. At 57, I still play garba until midnight. It isn’t a mere dance to me anymore, it’s a reminder that joy has no boundaries, no age, no passport.

Even today, when I close my eyes, I’m transported back to Mumbai – hearing the dhol, feeling the rain on my face, and reliving the nights that will stay in my heart forever.",59463,654,486909,65640.09,0.1873015873015873,0.39087301587301587,5.836451612903225
TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“My story began at a dressing table in Jaipur. My mother always wanted a daughter, so as a child she dressed me up & sat me beside her. I watched her apply kajal, lipstick, & get ready for festivals. Surrounded by my mother, sister, & cousins, I began to see clothes not just as fabric, but as an expression of self.

But that expression came at a cost. My family was in the marble business, & it was expected I would be too. So when I said I wanted to pursue fashion, it was unthinkable. But my mother was always in my corner, cheering me on, even when I chose to leave Jaipur for fashion school in Mumbai.

Mumbai opened me up to the world of design & styling. I spent years learning, & building my voice in fashion. After that, I moved to Baroda for another degree, & it was there that I discovered Garba. My first Navratri there, I didn’t know a single step. But then, I learned, competed, & even won prizes. Soon, it stopped being about winning – Garba became devotion. Even today, I travel from Jaipur to Baroda every Navratri, to play all night. In fact, right now, I’m here, dancing like I do every year.

As I built confidence on the Garba floor, I also built it in my clothes. I never believed fashion had a gender. I wore skirts, saris with kurtas, jackets inspired by maharajas. I posted it online – I was just being myself. One Garba video suddenly went viral. Overnight, my world changed. But along with love came hate. Millions of views meant thousands of cruel comments: ‘chakka,’ ‘bas ab choodiya pehen le,’ ‘why is he dressed like a woman?’ Offline too, there were stares & whispers. But I never replied. I kept showing up, because the moment I doubted myself, they would win.

This year, I launched my brand Rukhalo, a Marwari word for guardian. With Rukhalo, I create timeless, unapologetically gender fluid clothing that reflects what I stand for. Today, at 29, I’m a freelance stylist, a content creator, & a founder.

At times when I think back to that boy at the dressing table, watching his mother get ready, I realise that he has come a long way. He has weathered the noise, stood tall, & has owned his identity.

TheHumansOfBombay,Entertainment,"“In the 1970s, I quit my job as an engineer at L&T to dedicate myself to Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy. 50 years later, I am still at the book centre I helped build; carrying his ideas forward. 

As a kid, I was an ardent reader of Mahatma Gandhi’s books and was very moved by his ideas of truth, non-violence and love. By the time I was in my late 30s, corporate life had lost meaning. I wanted to lead a more purposeful life. Soon after, I joined the Bombay Sarvodaya Mandal – a Gandhian public charitable trust dedicated to spreading his teachings. 

In 1982, Richard Attenborough’s film, Gandhi was released in India. People thronged to the theatres to see the film. There was a resurgence of interest in Bapuji’s works. One day, my co-workers and I went to Regal Cinema in Colaba and started selling his autobiography to people coming out of the cinema hall. The response was very enthusiastic. This led us to opening our book centre, a place for those eager to delve deeper into his writings.

Now, we have more than 200 books on Mahatma Gandhi. A major chunk of our collection features books written by Gandhiji himself. We also conduct activities and examinations based on his philosophy. 

During one such exam, I met Laxman Gole, a prisoner who was under trial at the Nasik jail for murder and extortion, among other charges. We gave him Gandhiji’s autobiography. It was a small, almost accidental gesture but he was completely hooked. The book impacted him in such a way that he pleaded guilty to all the charges against him and even wrote a letter to the judge expressing repentance. 

With war and political conflicts escalating all over the world today, it is all the more important for us to recall Gandhiji’s insistence on love and non-violence.

I am 88 now, and I still live in these rooms where the thoughts of Gandhiji comforted and inspired me. I hope my work continues to immortalise his ideas and ideals for generations to come.”

At least nine more children remain on life support with failing kidneys. Tests have found dangerously high levels of diethylene glycol in syrups such as Coldrif, ReLife, and Respifresh TR. This echoes past tragedies like the 2020 Coldbest PC deaths in Jammu & Kashmir, highlighting systemic regulatory failures. In Madhya Pradesh, the burden has been shifted to the Doctor who prescribed the syrup. However, the Indian Medical Association has posed a valid question: How can a doctor possibly know that a cough syrup is contaminated? Shouldn’t the accountability fall on regulators and, most importantly, the company that manufactured these syrups? While several states have moved to ban these syrups, it appears to be too late for many victims. How many more children must die before the government wakes up and enforces safety measures?

Many called the trolling baseless, praising Deepika for her grace and cultural sensitivity. “She looks regal, respectful, and proud,” a fan shared. Others applauded her global representation, saying, “This is how you respect every culture beautifully.”

YouthKiAwaaz(images),Political,"How easy is it to move around Bengaluru on foot? For some, the city feels connected - short walks to the store, the bus stop, or a park. For many others, broken roads, missing sidewalks, and inaccessible paths make even a simple trip exhausting, unsafe, or impossible.

Walkability goes beyond having sidewalks; it’s about safety, comfort, and the ability to reach what you need in your daily life. Accessibility matters - smooth paths, shaded streets, reliable public transit, and spaces designed for people with disabilities or chronic illnesses.

When cities consider these realities, they become not just easier to navigate but also more resilient to the growing challenges of heat, floods, and other climate impacts.

How can urban design, inclusive infrastructure, and walkable streets help Bengaluru adapt to climate change and work for all its residents?

We want to hear from you: How does Bengaluru include or exclude its residents in building a climate-resilient city? Share your story at www.youthkiawaaz.com and help imagine a more walkable, accessible, and resilient Bengaluru.

YouthKiAwaaz(images),Political,"When the Reimagining India series aired in October 2021, Anjali Bharadwaj spoke of a nation where the people - not just the powerful - could demand accountability. She insisted that just India must nurture citizens who ask questions, protect dissenters, and ensure institutions act on those demands.

In recent times, that vision confronts stark reality. Digital journalist Rajeev Pratap, aged 36, went missing on September 18, 2025, and was later found dead in the Bhagirathi River near Joshiyara barrage. Post-mortem findings point to internal injuries consistent with an accident, yet his family alleges foul play linked to his investigations into local corruption. An SIT has been formed, but the questions his death raises - about fear, safety, and institutional response - are the very ones Bharadwaj urged the nation to confront.

Her words echo through moments like these, reminding us that democracy cannot survive if citizens are afraid to ask questions. It's time to carry that vision forward.

YouthKiAwaaz(images),Political,"""Toh muddha pata hai kya hai? Poochho pyar se, aram se, aur kya?"" This line from 'Mard Kaun Hai Asli', a rap created by MTV Nishedh, cuts straight to the heart of the issue: consent is not optional. In a society where toxic masculinity still shapes behavior, this rap challenges men to rethink what it really means to be ""a man.""

Toxic masculinity doesn't just harm individuals - it impacts relationships, families, and society. In India, marital rape continues to be largely invisible in law, and NFHS-5 data shows nearly 30% of women aged 15-49 have experienced physical or s+xual violence from a partner. These statistics reveal a grim reality: lack of consent and normalized coercion affect millions every day.

The rap emphasizes something simple yet revolutionary: respect, communication, and asking matter. Whether it's in marriage, dating, or everyday interactions, consent is a responsibility, not a favor. The message is clear: True strength lies in empathy and respect, not control. Start the conversation, listen carefully, and always ask.

It's your turn: Ask, listen, and respect. Make consent the foundation of every relationship.

YouthKiAwaaz(images),Political,"Sometimes being yourself feels like a rebellion. @chapter2drip's recent ad, directed by @rhea_chakraborty , shows that love doesn’t need permission, and honesty shouldn’t be hidden. A simple conversation between two siblings - one sharing that they're dating a guy - becomes a quiet act of courage, reflecting the realities LGBTQIA+ community face every day.

The supportive reaction reminds us how powerful acceptance within families can be. It’s proof that safe spaces start at home, where love is celebrated and identities are respected without shame.

Because closets are meant for clothes not for who you love. Watch the ad, share it, and help create a world where every LGBTQIA+ individual feels free to be themselves, starting with the family that surrounds them.

YouthKiAwaaz(images),Political,"There are songs that echo softly. And then there are songs like 'Darya Ki Kasam' - that roar through time.

Written by Kamla Bhasin and sung by generations of women, this anthem emerged from a moment when voices from across South Asia gathered in Lahore in 1995, declaring that women’s freedom could no longer be contained - not by borders, not by faith, not by patriarchy.

The song pierces through the imposed veil - literally and metaphorically - asking: “Ye parda kaisa parda hai? Kya ye mazhab ka hissa hai?” It questions how religion and culture are often twisted into tools of control, and how systems built by men decide what women should wear, how they should walk, when they should speak.

Thirty years later, this bold feminist anthem still feels like a mirror. The imposition may change its language - from dress codes to online policing - but the struggle remains the same. Every time this song is sung, it revives a collective promise: to rise, to resist, and to rebuild a world where women define their own faith, their own freedom, their own voice.

Have you heard this anthem of women’s movement before?

YouthKiAwaaz(images),Political,"From Ajmer Sharif to the city’s narrow lanes, three young women picked up their cameras to ask one simple, unsettling question: “Ajmer ki ladkiyan kahan hain?”

They are everywhere, yet somehow invisible - in classrooms, at bus stops, in markets, moving quickly through the city each day. Their presence feels fleeting, always in transit, never rooted in the rhythms of public life.

This is not just Ajmer’s story. Across Indian cities, women’s movements are shaped by invisible boundaries of time, safety, and expectation. Public spaces belong to them too, yet the freedom to simply be in those spaces is often denied.

This youth-led film, created during the Cities for Youth fellowship with Safetipin, shines a light on that absence. Through conversations, street interviews, and lived observations, it asks what our cities might look like if women were as visible, comfortable, and rooted in public space as men.

Shot across Ajmer’s landmarks - its parks, buses, markets, and the shrine that holds its heart - the project is both a record and a reclaiming. A reminder that a city only feels whole when its women are not just passing through it, but shaping its everyday life.

This Urban October, Youth Ki Awaaz and Safetipin come together to spotlight how young people are reshaping their cities and reclaiming their spaces.

YouthKiAwaaz(images),Political,"""Periods kaa matlab healthy hainn aap"" - a line from Whisper’s initiative that celebrates early menstruation awareness.

In India, menstruation begins in kids’ lives sometimes as early as 8, yet many lack the knowledge and support to manage it. Without proper education and access to sanitary products, millions risk missing school, losing opportunities, and facing stigma at a young age.

The reality is harsher than we talk about. Periods are still treated as shameful or “dirty,” conversations are silenced, and young menstruators are forced to hide or feel embarrassed. This stigma can cause isolation, anxiety, and even dropout from school, making a natural and healthy process a source of fear instead of empowerment.

According to UNICEF's 2023 report, 23% of students in India miss school due to menstruation-related challenges. Awareness, access, and support can change this narrative.

Periods are a sign of health, not a hurdle. Let’s empower the next generation with knowledge, dignity, and the freedom to stay in school.

Spread awareness. Break stigma. Support period education.
